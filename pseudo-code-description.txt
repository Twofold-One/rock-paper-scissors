Tasks for UI version:
In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.
a. For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
b. Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that calls your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
c. Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
d. Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
e. You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of the programmer’s life.
f. Once you’re all done with your UI and make sure everything’s satisfactory, it’s time to merge our current branch rps-ui to our main branch.





Tasks for console version:
1. computerPlay function
Add variable (randomVar) to store number 1, 2 or 3.
Create a function randomVarFunc which generates random integer values from 1 to 3 and return it in (randomVar).
Create a function assignFunc which assigns integer 1, 2, 3 in (randomVar) to Rock, Paper, Scissors accordingly and return that value.
Return string value of randomVar.

2. playRound function
Add variables (playerSelection, computerSelection).
Assign (computerSelection) to the returned result of computerPlay function.
//maybe make it a function which will return error if input is incorrect
Assing (playerSelection) from promting the user to input "rock, paper or scissors" in promt window.
Round condition
If (playerSelection) is Rock run funcRock
If (playerSelection) is Paper run funcPaper
If (playerSelection) is Scissors run funcScissors
Else run alert choose proper thing

Few functions which use switch for every selection:
a) funcRock
If (computerSelection) is Rock print "Tie, play again"
If (computerSelection) is Paper print "You lose, Paper beats Rock"
If (computerSelection) is Scissors print "You win, Rock beats Scissors"

3. game function
Add variables (playerScore), (computerScore) with initial values of 0.

while (playerScore) + (computerScore) < 5
run playRound function;
if func result is win (playerScore) + 1;
else if func result is lose (computerScore) + 1;

if (playerScore) > (computerScore) console.log playerScore is ..., computerScore is..., player wins!
else console.log playerScore is ..., computerScore is..., computer wins!
